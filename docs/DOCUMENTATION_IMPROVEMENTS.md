# Code Documentation Improvements

I've added comprehensive inline documentation throughout the codebase to help with understanding and maintenance. Here's a summary of the improvements:

## 📁 Files Enhanced with Documentation

### 1. `src/api_client.py` - API Client & Smart Rate Limiting
**Key improvements:**
- **Certificate Authentication**: Explained PKCS12 adapter setup and client certificate mounting
- **Smart Rate Limiting Logic**: Detailed comments on the new conditional rate limiting system
- **Cache Detection**: Explained how the system tracks API calls vs cache hits
- **File Download Logic**: Documented CAD/image format detection and streaming downloads
- **API Response Processing**: Clarified Bearer token authentication and request flow

**Example additions:**
```python
# SMART RATE LIMITING: Track if any API calls are made for this product
# Only apply rate limiting delays when we actually hit the API
api_calls_made = False

# PKCS12 (.pfx) files contain both private key and certificate for client auth
pkcs12_adapter = Pkcs12Adapter(...)
```

### 2. `src/label_generator.py` - Multi-Pass Layout Algorithm
**Key improvements:**
- **Multi-Pass Algorithm**: Explained the 3-pass optimization approach
- **Image Scaling Logic**: Documented aspect ratio preservation and constraint detection
- **Text Positioning**: Clarified vertical centering and coordinate system
- **Font Hierarchy**: Explained priority system (dimensions > description > product ID)
- **Text Wrapping**: Documented ReportLab stringWidth usage for accurate measurements

**Example additions:**
```python
# MULTI-PASS ALGORITHM: Replaces complex nested loops with clean 3-pass approach
# This provides better space utilization while maintaining font hierarchy

# PASS 1: Baseline fitting - establish safe layout that definitely fits
# Uses conservative font sizes to ensure no text clipping occurs

# Compare scaling factors to see which dimension constrains the image
if self.image_width / img_width < self.page_height / img_height:
    # Width-constrained: image is too wide, scale by width
```

### 3. `src/main.py` - Command Line Interface
**Key improvements:**
- **Input Handling**: Explained file vs command-line argument processing
- **Environment Validation**: Documented security requirements for API credentials
- **Progress Tracking**: Clarified user feedback during potentially slow operations
- **Error Handling**: Explained validation steps and user-friendly error messages

**Example additions:**
```python
# Handle input sources - either command line args or file
# User can provide product IDs directly or via a text file (one per line)

# Skip empty lines and comments (lines starting with #)
if line and not line.startswith('#'):
    file_product_ids.append(line)
```

### 4. `src/image_processor.py` - Image Processing Pipeline
**Key improvements:**
- **DPI and Sizing**: Explained pixel calculations for high-quality printing
- **Color Mode Handling**: Documented transparency and color space conversions
- **Aspect Ratio Logic**: Clarified scaling and centering calculations
- **Quality Settings**: Explained LANCZOS resampling for optimal image quality

**Example additions:**
```python
# Calculate pixel dimensions based on physical label size and print DPI
# Label is 1.0" x 0.5" at 300 DPI for high-quality printing

# Choose the smaller scale factor to ensure image fits in both dimensions
scale_ratio = min(width_ratio, height_ratio)

# Apply padding (90% of available space) to avoid touching label edges
```

### 5. `src/config.py` - Configuration Management
**Key improvements:**
- **Security Documentation**: Explained environment variable usage for credentials
- **API Endpoint Mapping**: Documented each endpoint's purpose
- **Physical Dimensions**: Clarified label sizing for printing requirements
- **Directory Structure**: Explained cache and output directory purposes

**Example additions:**
```python
# API Credentials - loaded from environment variables for security
# These should be set in .env file, never hardcoded

# Label Configuration - physical dimensions for printing
# Small labels for parts bins: 1.5" wide x 0.5" tall

# Caching dramatically improves performance by avoiding repeated API calls
```
