# McMaster-Carr API Configuration
# This file contains non-sensitive configuration options.
# Sensitive credentials (API username, password, and certificate password) 
# should be set as environment variables or will be prompted when running the application.

# SSL Verification (set to 'true' to verify server certificates, 'false' to disable)
# Note: McMaster-Carr API may use internal CAs, so you might need to set this to 'false'
MCMASTER_SSL_VERIFY=false

# To set credentials as environment variables (instead of being prompted):
# export MCMASTER_API_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
# export MCMASTER_API_PASSWORD=your-password
