# Files that SHOULD be committed (exceptions to .gitignore)

# Keep these files even though they match ignore patterns:
# - .env.example (template for environment variables)
# - requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
# - pytest.ini (test configuration)
# - README.md and other documentation
# - Makefile (build automation)
# - src/ directory (all source code)
# - tests/ directory (all tests)
# - product_id.txt files (example product lists)

# Note: The actual certificate files (*.pfx, *.pem) should NEVER be committed
# Only commit instructions on how to obtain/generate them
